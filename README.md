# Predicting-Customer-Churn-at-SyriaTel-A-Strategic-Analysis-to-Improve-Retention
This project predicts customer churn at SyriaTel, a telecommunications company, using data science and machine learning. It analyzes historical data to identify churn patterns, helping SyriaTel improve retention, reduce revenue loss, and make informed decisions through a binary classification model.

## Business Understanding 
Churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the percentage of customers who discontinue or stop using a company’s services during a given period. For telecommunications companies like SyriaTel, churn is a critical metric because it directly impacts revenue growth and profitability. When a customer leaves, the company not only loses the revenue from that customer but also incurs higher costs in trying to acquire new customers to replace them.

Acquiring new customers is significantly more expensive than retaining existing ones, with estimates suggesting that it's up to 5 times more costly. In a highly competitive global market, telecom companies face the constant challenge of retaining customers who have various options and can easily switch providers. High churn rates increase the costs of acquiring new customers and maintaining market share, affecting a company’s ability to grow and invest in new technologies or services.

Predicting and reducing churn is not only essential for sustaining SyriaTel’s market position but also for ensuring its capacity to grow, innovate, and provide competitive services in a rapidly evolving industry.

## Problem Statement
SyriaTel, a telecommunications company, is facing a high customer churn rate, negatively impacting its revenue growth and profitability. Customer acquisition is up to five times more expensive than retaining existing customers, making this a significant financial challenge. In an increasingly competitive market with numerous alternatives for customers, high churn rates make it difficult for SyriaTel to maintain its market share, reinvest in innovation, and achieve long-term growth.

## Objectives
1. To Identify Churn Rates by Region and which region is highly affected.
2. To examine the impact of Account Length on Churn. Which customesrs are highly prone to attrition.
3. To assess the influence of subscription plans (voicemail and international plans) on churn.
4. To evaluate the impact of customer service calls on churn and determine if there is a statistically significant relationship.
5. To predict churn by focusing on the most influential features that drive customer behavior and retention patterns.

## Success Metrics
The success metric for this project would be to achieve a recall rate of at least 70%, ensuring that the model identifies a significant percentage of customers at risk of churning. This will allow the business to proactively target retention efforts, minimizing customer loss while balancing the cost of engaging non-churners. With this, SyriaTel will take timely retention actions and allocate resources more effectively to prevent churn.
